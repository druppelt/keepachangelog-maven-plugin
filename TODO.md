# TODO

Possible future implementations:

 * Support for Subversion (it will some code restructure).
 * Replacing regex with a real Markdown parser would make the plugin less error
   prone or perhaps a specific Changelog parser.
 * The validation task could check if the order of the types of changes is
   correct.
 * Check all versions have reference links except the first version.
 * A formatter would be nice to have.
 * A task to add a new change would be nice to have.
